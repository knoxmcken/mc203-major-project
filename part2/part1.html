<h3> Part 2: Absolute Maxima and Minima </h3>
The concentration \(C(t)\) of a drug in the bloodstream \(t\) hours after it has been injected is commonly modeled by an equation of the form
\[
C(t)=\frac{K\left(e^{-b t}-e^{-a t}\right)}{a-b}
\] where \(K>0\) and \(a>b>0\).

<ol type="a">
    <li> Find the first and second derivative of \(C(t)\) to determine the time at which the maximum concentration occur. </li>
    <li> Suppose \(K=1, a = 1.5,\) and \(b = 1.0\) for a particular drug. Use Excel to plot the changing concentration levels over the next 5 hours. Use 0.25 intervals in your plot. Use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jHxDxhGcRfPNbbe74MxWwOQjxvdNCeqAqseAgm1XugQ/edit?usp=sharing" > this Excel Template </a>.

    <li> Check if your graph in (b) agrees with your answer in (a). \(C(t) \) for the given parameters of \(K\), \(a\) and \(b\).</li>
</ol>
