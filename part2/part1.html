<h3> Part 2: Absolute Maxima and Minima </h3>
The concentration \(C(t)\) of a drug in the bloodstream \(t\) hours after it has been injected is commonly modeled by an equation of the form
\[
C(t)=\frac{K\left(e^{-b t}-e^{-a t}\right)}{a-b}
\]
where \(K>0\) and \(a>b>0\).
<ol type="a">
    <li> At what time does the maximum concentration occur?</li>
    <li> Let \(K=1\). Use Excel to plot the graph of the equation in (a).
    <li> Check if your graph in (b) agrees with your answer in (a). \(C(t) \) for various values of \(a\) and \(b\).</li>
</ol>
