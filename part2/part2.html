<h3> Part 1: Optimization: Maiximum and Minimum Problems</h3>
<b> Optimizing Revenue and Profit</b><br></br>

<p> If \(x\) is the number of items sold, \(p\) the price of each item, \(C(x)\) the cost of producing \(x\) items, \(R(x)\) the revenue from selling \(x\) items, and \(P(x)\) the profit from selling \(x\) items. Then: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The revenue of selling \(x\) items is: <b> \(R(x) = p \times x \) </b>.
    <li> The profit from selling \(x\) items is therefore: <b> \(P(x) = R(x) - C(x) \) </b> </li>
    <li> The <i> maximum profit </i> is the profit obtained by by selling \(x_0\) units, where \(P'(x_0) = 0\) and \(P''(x_0) > 0 \).</li>
</ul>

<p>
A firm determines that \(x\) units of its product can be sold daily at \(p\) K100.00 per unit, and the cost of producing \(x\) units per day is \(C(x)=3000+20 x\).

<ol type="a">
    <li> Complete the <b> Revenue and Profit Table </b> by entering the correct formula under Revenue and Profit Columns.</li>
    <li> Use the table in (a) to plot a <b> Units vs Profit Table </b> chart, where numer of units is on the x-axis and amount of profit is on the y-axis. Use line chart </li>
    <li> Use your chart in (b) to estimate the number of products to produce for a maximum profit.</li>
    <li> Now use analytical method to verify your conclusion in (c) </li>
</ol>

 Suppose the cost of producing \(x\) units is given by \(x = 1000 - p \).
 <ol type="a">
    <li> Complete the <b> Revenue and Profite Table</b> </li>
    <li> Plot the <b> Profit vs Price </b> Chart </li> 
    <li> From your graph in (b), determine the price for which maximum profit can be made. </li>
    <li> Apply analytical method to find the price that maximumes the  profitt.</li>
 </ol>

 <!--- (a) Find the revenue function \(R(x)\).

(b) Find the profit function \(P(x)\).
(c) Assuming that the production capacity is at most 500 units per day, determine how many units the company must produce and sell each day to maximize the profit.
(d) Find the maximum profit.
(e) What price per unit must be charged to obtain the maximum profit?
